### IgProcessBuySellFunction

- **Purpose**: 
  - The `IgProcessBuySellFunction` is designed to handle the execution of buy and sell orders based on trading signals. It acts as a bridge between the trading strategy outputs and the actual execution of trades on the IG trading platform.

- **Logic**:
  1. **Receive Trading Signals**:
     - The function receives trading signals generated by the `IgRunStrategyFunction`. These signals indicate whether to buy or sell specific stocks.

  2. **Execute Buy/Sell Orders**:
     - Based on the received signals, the function executes the corresponding buy or sell orders on the IG trading platform. This involves interacting with the platform's API to place the orders.

  3. **Record Transaction Details**:
     - After executing the orders, the function records the transaction details. This includes information such as the stock symbol, order type (buy/sell), quantity, price, and timestamp.
     - The transaction details are stored in the `TransactionTable` and `EquityTable` DynamoDB tables. This storage is essential for tracking the performance and history of trades.

- **Output**:
  - The function outputs confirmation of the executed trades and updates the transaction records, ensuring that the trading system maintains an accurate and up-to-date record of all trading activities.
